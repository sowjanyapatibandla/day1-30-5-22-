     <li>What is React? What are its features</li> React was created by Jordane Walkie , a software engineer at 
     facebook in the year 2011 and it was deployed first at the facebook newsfeed and later it was used in 
     facebook and instagram. React is a open source front end js library. it follos the component based approach for 
     building reusable UI components specially for single page application and it is used for developing interactive 
     view layer of web and mobile applications. 
    </ol>
<ul>
    <li>virtual Dom</li>
    <li>one way Data Binding</li>
    <li>Reusable component</li>
    <li>JSX(JavaSCript Syntex Extension)</li>
    <li>Performance</li>
</ul>
<li> Explain Virtual Dom</li>Dom is a document object model,created by converting HTML CSS and JS Real Dom,
which is an object which gets created whenever any react application gets loaded on the screen for the first time.,
whenevere react components gets mounted on the screen for the first time.now when any user makes any changes on 
the screen like button click because of which the state variable will gets updated so in this case the changes 
will not directly go to real Dom,instead in react we have concept known virtual DOM. so we are having two virtual doms,
one virtual dom gets created at the time of mounting of react component so it is a copy of your real dom .another virtual
dom is the dom which contains the new changes,updated state variable values. now these two virtual doms will get
compared with each other and will check for the new changes. thi scomplete procedure is known as diffing algorthim, 
no wthe new changes will be updated in your real dom.this procedure is known as recoincilliation.
<li>Explain Diffing Algorthim</li>
<li>React, Angular or Veu</li>
Library is a set of reusable functions used by computer programme and framework is a piece of code that 
dictates the architecture of a project, code calls the library but in framwork , framework calls the code . 
in library we can control the data flow by methods but in framework we dont have any control of the data 
flow framework decides how the data will flow that is nothing but frameworks calls the code . and in performance 
wise react is having higher performance over angular and veu and community support and also react is having the 
easy learning curve and react is having SPA(single page application) . 
<li>Class vs function</li>
<ul>
    <li>class component uses the lifecycle methods where as in functional component have HOOKs</li>
    <li>Functional component are also caleed stateless  component is called statefull component and 
        there is no render function while in functional there is return</li>
    <li> functional component accepts props as argument but props and state can be accepeted in class 
        components</li>
    <li>functional component are easy to read as they have less code but the classs component have complex
        code structure and hard to write. </li>
    <li>In class component we uses the "this" keyword but in functional we dont need the keyword</li>
</ul>
<li>sateless vs statefull</li> Stateless component does not hold or manage state while statefull component 
can hold or manage state, stateless component are easy to understand but the statefull component  it is complex
as compared to the stateless component . stateless components does not work with react lifecycles but whereas 
statefull work with lifecycle methods. stateless can not be reused while can be used in case of statefull component. 
stateless component is also known as functional component. statefull is known as class component . 
<li>What are the different phases of React component's lifecycle</li>In ReactJS, every component craetion process
involves various lifecycle methods. These lifecycle methods are not very complicated and called at various 
points during a component's life. the lifecycle of the component is divided into four phases . they are:
1.Initial phase
2.Mounting phase 
3.Updating phase
4.Unmounting phase
Each phase contain some lifecycle methods that are specific to the particular phase.
